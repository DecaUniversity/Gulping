# Gulping: My Pipeline Adventure

This project has been a phenomenal learning experience. I am satisfied with the progress that I made on revamping my Gulp workflow. Instead of banging against the wall or blaming the tool, I decided to go back to basics and refresh my understanding of Gulp and fill any knowledge gaps that may be leading me to have a broken workflow. 

What an amazing experience it was to take my time to understand better what Gulp does and how it works. I incrementally built this project to advance from the very basics into the final Gulp workflow that I need for my Angular development. I saw myself not only reading more but also reading more carefully. This time, I was not copying and pasting code mindlessly from an example on Github or Stackoverflow. Nop. This time I was reading the code and making sure I was understanding what it was doing. I was diving into the documentation to understand the tool and the plugins I was using. I tested each code block in different ways to ensure the task was doing what I wanted and had the sufficient fallbacks to prevent complete failure or was strengthen to handle different use cases (such as not just changing a file, but adding a new one or deleting one).

It went from a messy buggy build to a performant beautiful one. 

Gulp yeah!
